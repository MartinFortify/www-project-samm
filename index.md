**Software Assurance Maturity Model**

Our mission is to provide an effective and **measurable** way for all types of organizations to analyze and **improve their software security** posture. We want to **raise awareness and educate** organizations on how to design, develop, and deploy secure software through our [**self-assessment model**](https://owaspsamm.org/assessment/). SAMM supports the complete software lifecycle and is technology and process agnostic. We built SAMM to be **evolutive and risk-driven** in nature, as there is no single recipe that works for all organizations.

**SAMM User Day!**

On June 16th, 2020 we’re having our first OWASP SAMM User Day online. During this User Day, we’ll share our practical experiences and lessons learned when using OWASP SAMM to improve your secure development practices.<br>

The Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) is an open framework to
help organizations formulate and implement a strategy for software
security that is tailored to the specific risks facing the organization.
SAMM helps you:

  - **Evaluate an organization’s existing software security practices**
  - **Build a balanced software security assurance program in
    well-defined iterations**
  - **Demonstrate concrete improvements to a security assurance
    program**
  - **Define and measure security-related activities throughout an
    organization**

help focus our resources and determine which components of our secure
application development program to prioritize.*, (**Michael J. Craigue,
