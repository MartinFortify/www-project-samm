# Get Involved

Involvement in the development of SAMM is actively encouraged!

You do not have to be a security expert in order to help out.

We have written some guidelines on our OWASPP SAMM website on [how you can contribute to SAMM](https://owaspsamm.org/contributing/).


## Feedback

Please use the [Github Issues](https://github.com/OWASP/samm/issues/new) for feedback:

* What do like?
* What don't you like?
* How can we make SAMM easier to use?
* How could SAMM be improved?

### Help us translate!

Are you fluent in another language? Can you help translate SAMM into
that language?

You can use [Crowdin](http://crowdin.net/project/owasp-samm) to do
that\!
